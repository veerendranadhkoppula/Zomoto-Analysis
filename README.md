# Unemployment Analysis in India
## Project Overview
Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate, which is the percentage of people unemployed in the total labor force. The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a sharp increase in unemployment rates across the world, and India was no exception. This project focuses on analyzing the unemployment rate in India during the Covid-19 pandemic using data from various regions of the country.

The dataset used in this project contains the unemployment rate, labor participation rate, and employment estimates across different states and regions in India.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

**Region:** Name of the region (e.g., Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka)<br>
**Date:** Date of the data record<br>
**Frequency:** Frequency of the data (e.g., monthly)<br>
**Estimated Unemployment Rate (%):** The unemployment rate estimated for that region<br>
**Estimated Employed:** Estimated number of employed people<br>
**Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%):** Labor participation rate for the region<br>
**Longitude and Latitude:** Geographical coordinates of the region<br>

## Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy

## Key Findings
- During the early months of 2020, a significant increase in the unemployment rate was observed, especially during the lockdown phases.
- Some regions experienced higher unemployment rates compared to others.
- The labor participation rate also fluctuated across different states.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a data-driven approach to analyzing unemployment in India during Covid-19. Visualizations and dashboards help in understanding the regional disparities in unemployment rates.
